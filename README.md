System requirements:
----------------------------------------------
1. ОС: Windows, Linux;
2. Qt 5.5.1 or higher;
3. OpenCV 2.4 or higher;
4. Compiler with support for c++ 11;
5. Web-camera.

Setup for Windows:
----------------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository;
2. If required, specify in file config.pri the path to directory of opencv libraries, the name of the libraries and the path to header files (by default  config.pri has the link to “dependencies” of the project with  binary files of opencv2 VC14);
3. Build the project.

Setup for Linux:
----------------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository;
2. Launch the console and run command “sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev”;
3. Build the project.

Compiled applications are located in folder “bin”

Remarks:
----------------------------------------------
OpenCV relies on the V4L2 (Video for Linux) module, so try adding the following line at the bottom of the file /etc/modules and rebooting your Raspberry Pi.

bcm2835-v4l2

This ensures that the Broadcom Video For Linux 2 (v4l2) driver is loaded at all subsequent reboots.
